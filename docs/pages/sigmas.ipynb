    "# A note about sigmas\n",
    "\n",
    "We are regularly asked about the default \"sigma\" confidence levels in the 2D histograms. The default confidence levels are `(0.118, 0.393, 0.675, 0.864)` corresponding to the `(0.5, 1, 1.5, 2)`-sigma confidence regions for a **2D** Gaussian distribution. These differ from the corresponding `(0.382, 0.683, 0.866, 0.955)` confidence intervals you would expect for a **1D** Guassian distribution. On this page, we will give a brief explanation about Gaussian distributions, confidence levels, and how the default `corner` confidence levels work.\n",
    "\n",
    "In one dimension, a Gaussian probability density is given by\n",
    "\n",
    "    pdf(r) = exp(-(r/s)^2/2) / sqrt(2*pi*s^2)\n",
    "\n",
    "If we integrate this distribution from `r = (-1*s, -2*s, -3*s)` to `(+1*s, +2*s, +3*s)` then we see that these ranges respectively include `(68.3%, 95.4%, 99.7%)` of the probability. Because scientists often report 1D confidence intervals and many distributions are approximately normal, it has become conventional to call reported confidence intervals  \"`n-σ` confidence intervals\" if the confidence level matches the probability contained in a 1D Gaussian distribution between `r=+/-n*s`. However, the relationship between, e.g., the 68.3% confidence level and `1-σ` doesn't make sense for non-Guassian distributions because those distributions may not be parametrized by a `σ` parameter at all. As we will see below, this relationship changes even for a 2D Gaussian density.\n",
    "\n",
    "In two dimensions, a Gaussian probability density is given by:\n",
    "\n",
    "    pdf(r) = exp(-(r/s)^2/2) / (2*pi*s^2)\n",
    "\n",
    "If we integrate (marginalize) over the polar angle and integrate the probability within a radius `r` from the center of the distribution we compute\n",
    "\n",
    "    cdf(r) = Integral(r' * exp(-(r'/s)^2/2) / s^2, {r', 0, r})\n",
    "           = 1 - exp(-(r/s)^2/2)\n",
    "\n",
    "From this calculation we see that for `r = (0.5*s, 1*s, 1.5*s, 2*s)` the included probability is `(11.8%, 39.3%, 67.5%, 86.4%)` matching the `corner.py` default confidence levels for the 2D histograms.\n",
    "\n",
    "The advantage of using the 2D Gaussian sigma confidence levels for the  2D histograms is that, for data that are approximately multivariate normally distributed and uncorrelated, the edges of the n-sigma confidence regions shown in the 2D histogram will line up with the n-sigma confidence intervals shown in the 1D histogram at the top of the figure column. See below."
